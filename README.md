# cookiecutter-stanford-progrj

A cookiecutter template for Stanford's Programming in Journalism course (Comm 177P/277P) in winter quarter 2020.

This template is intended for use in tandem with datakit and datakit-github.

## Settings

Environmental settings can be used to control template behavior.


* `PROGJ_GH_INTEGRATE` (default: true) - set to "false" to disable Github project generation
* `PROGJ_GH_ADD_COLLABS` (default: true) - set to "false" to disable adding collaborators. This is most useful when instructors are developing on the repo and want to avoid spamming other instructors.
* `PROGJ_GH_COLLABORATORS` - colon-separated list of GitHub usernames (e.g. user1:user2)
